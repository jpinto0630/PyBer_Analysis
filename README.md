# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

We were tasked with the analysis and creation of summary statistics for trip data from Pyber's proprietary company data. The analysis consisted of city and trip data for rides taken in January to April 2019. The data was provided in two CSV files and was analyzed/manipulated using Python with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. 

## Results

The first analysis conducted primarily examined the monetary difference between total trips in three city categories: ‘Rural’, ‘Suburban’, and ‘Urban’. From the imagine above we see that for the data range specified the majority of Pyber rides and revenue come from trips taken in Urban cities. In an interesting contrast the average fare per ride is higher in rural areas, most likely explained by the larger distances between locales.

The above chart allows us to visualize the data on a weekly basis, we can then observe general trends such as busy time periods. In the chart above we see that the three city types are distinct in their total volume, however they share similar “peak” or “busy” seasons, in this case late February and March. 


## Summary

Based on the data we have outlined the following three recommendation for the CEO: 

1.	In order to address the driver disparity between city types, a small premium or commission could be offered to rural and suburban driver. This would allow for more drivers in these areas and greater coverage to users. 
2.	Gather and deeply analyze data from late February 2019. This time period saw a spike in rides for all three city types, there could be some external factors that PyBer could try replicating or be better prepared for in order to recreate or capitalize in similar spikes. 
3.	Continue to foster ridership in Urban cities. Most of the revenue is attained in this city type and fostering the growth and maintenance of a strong product in your core audience is vital to continued success.
