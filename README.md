##Overview of the analysis

We were tasked with the analysis and creation of summary statistics for trip data from Pyber's proprietary company data. The analysis consisted of city and trip data for rides taken in January to April 2019. The data was provided in two CSV files and was analyzed/manipulated using Python with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
